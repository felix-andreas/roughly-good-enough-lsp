# Roughly 🔥

### The R(oughly good enough) Language Server

</div>

Welcome to Roughly, the language server where we skip the fancy AST parsing and go straight to the syntax (just regex), because who has time for that when your R project is already making your computer cry?

## Installation

### Client

Bundle the client (or [download from here](https://github.com/felix-andreas/roughly/releases)):

```
npm run package
```

Install the VS code extension:

```
code --install-extension roughly.vsix
```

### Server

Build the server (or [download from here](https://github.com/felix-andreas/roughly/releases)):

```
cargo build --release
```

Configure the client via the `settings.json` to use the server binary:

```json
{
  "roughly.path": "<path>"
}
```

## Usage

Start the language server:

```
roughly lsp
```

To run roughly as a formatter:

```
roughly fmt                # Format all files in the current directory
roughly fmt <path>         # Format all files in `<path>`
roughly fmt --check        # Only check if files would be formatted
roughly fmt --diff         # Only show diff if files would be formatted
```

Or, to run Roughly as a linter:

```
roughly lint               # Lint all files in the current directory
roughly lint <path>        # Lint all files in `<path>`
```

## Project layout

Currenlty this extension assume that your `R` code has the following folder structure:

| Path        | Type      |
|-------------|-----------|
| `R`         | directory |
| `R/*.R`     | file      |
| `NAMESPACE` | file      |


## Development

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in the client
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to start compiling the client in [watch mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#:~:text=The%20first%20entry%20executes,the%20HelloWorld.js%20file.).
- Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down (if it is not already).
- Press ▷ to run the launch config (F5).
- In the [Extension Development Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension#:~:text=Then%2C%20inside%20the%20editor%2C%20press%20F5.%20This%20will%20compile%20and%20run%20the%20extension%20in%20a%20new%20Extension%20Development%20Host%20window.) instance of VSCode, open a document with a `.R` extension.
  - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>O</kbd> to search document symbols
  - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd> to search workspace symbols

### Words of warning

The `launch.json` contains a setting:

```json
"autoAttachChildProcesses": true,
```

For me this led to the issue that the language server wasn't spawned because I had `CodeLLDB` from `nixpkgs` installed.
